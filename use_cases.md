# Use Cases and Methodology

This document describes in the form of a process the possible use cases in comparing
the linguistic phenomena of two corpora.

### Pre: Some Assumptions of the user

The user is assumed to have chosen 2 corpus that are only different in 1 aspect (taking the ideal case here maybe?)
when *juxtorpusing* them to reveal linguistic distinctions within this particular context defined by the aspect.

A concrete example:
Comparing two corpora of tweets from two different authors but in the same time interval (during 2019-2020)

### 1. Linguistic makeup of corpus (characteristic phrases)

1. Extract the keywords from the corpora
2. Compare their frequencies
3. Study the collocations of these keywords and perhaps identify any shifts.
    1. using visualisations OR frequencies
4. (Out of scope) whether this shift is based on chance or not.

### 2. Topic modelling of corpus
* SVD/LSA
* LDA

### 3. Clustering - (requires input from Sony)
* KMeans
* DBScan
